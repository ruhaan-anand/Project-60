        <h2>My Favourite Character</h2>
        <p>
    My favourite cartoon character is Martin Kratt from my favourite cartoon "Wild Kratts". Wild Kratts is a cartoon about animals and tells why you should not hunt animals. There are 2 brothers Martin and Chris, thes brothers are zoologists in reality but they have made a sci-fi cartoon on them and my favourite character is Martin. They wear a power suit. Aviva is a girl in the cartoon who programs the sut as it can provide Martin and Chris the powers of any animals she programs it for. They use these animal powers to stp hunters to hunt animals and survive in the wild while they are doing adventures. I like Martin because his favourite colour and my favourite colour is the same "blue". His favourite thing to do while adventuring is swimming and i also love swimming. So this is why I like the cartoon character "Martin Kratt".
